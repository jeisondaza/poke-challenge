This "pokedex" is built on the Vue.js framework in its version 3 using exclusively the new Composition API and Vite (created by Evan You, the same creator of Vuejs) as a bundler, since it is a very high performance option in terms of development experience.

I used the gitflow flow for repository management.

You can see the project in production at https://poke-challenge-seven.vercel.app/squirtle deployed on Vercel.
